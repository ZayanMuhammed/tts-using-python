🗣️ Python Text-to-Speech (TTS)
This project demonstrates how to convert text into human-like speech using Python. Text-to-Speech (TTS) enables applications to read text out loud, making software more accessible, interactive, and intelligent.

🔍 What is Python TTS?
Text-to-Speech (TTS) is a technology that converts written text into spoken voice using synthetic speech. Python offers multiple libraries to implement TTS quickly and easily, such as:

pyttsx3 – Offline and platform-independent

gTTS – Google’s online TTS API

TTS (by coqui.ai) – Neural voice synthesis (offline and multilingual)

🎯 Use Cases
Python TTS can be used in a variety of real-world applications:

✅ Voice Assistants
Speak out responses, reminders, weather updates, or the time.

✅ Accessibility Tools
Help visually impaired users by reading text aloud from screens or documents.

✅ Audiobook Generation
Convert eBooks, articles, or any long-form text into .mp3 audio files.

✅ Educational Applications
Language learning tools, pronunciation apps, or spelling guides.

✅ Hands-Free Alerts
Add voice notifications to smart devices, automation systems, or robots.

✅ Multilingual Speech Apps
Speak in multiple languages using TTS engines that support international voices.

✅ Games and Interactive Stories
Add narrated storylines or spoken character dialogues.

🛠️ Features
🔊 Convert text to speech in real-time

💾 Save speech as audio files (e.g., .mp3)

🌍 Support for multiple languages (depending on the library)

💻 Works offline (with pyttsx3 or TTS)
